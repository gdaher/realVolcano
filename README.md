# realVolcano
Rshiny web app. Makes a downloadable volcano plot from an uploaded excel spreadsheet. You can choose the columns for the x any y axes using a dropdown menu. This was an idea for increasing the ease of data visualisation in the sciences, as many scientists cannot program and making customized graphs is time-consuming.
